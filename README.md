***Simple automated test script using Python with the help of Selenium.***

To ensure the proper functioning of Selenium with Chrome, it is imperative to maintain compatibility between the installed Chrome browser and the corresponding ChromeDriver version. Currently, my local Chrome browser is version 116, while the available ChromeDriver version is 114. Unfortunately, I have been unable to locate a ChromeDriver version 116, as it appears to have not been released as of my last knowledge update in September 2021.

Things that can be done:

1.Check for Chrome and ChromeDriver Updates.

2.Downgrade Chrome Browser if necessary, but be cautious when performing this downgrade, as it may impact your browsing experience and security. Ensure that you backup any essential data or settings before proceeding.

3.Explore the possibility of using alternative web browsers that have compatible ChromeDriver versions available.

4.Consider using a WebDriver manager library or tool that can automatically download and manage the appropriate version of ChromeDriver based on your Chrome browser version.
